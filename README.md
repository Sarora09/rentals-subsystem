# rentals-subsystem

As a part of the course requirement at NAIT, I developed a Rentals subsystem out of four assigned to my team of four classmates using ASP.NET Framework (C#) and Microsoft SQL Server database. Each team member was responsible for completing one subsystem. The project was shared using GIT Version Control and linked to a local database installed on each team member's system.

The subsystem utilized web forms with HTML and Bootstrap for frontend and Business Logic Layer, Data Access Layer, LINQ queries, and reverse engineered entities for the backend. Rentals subsystem comprised of following two separate pages:

• The rentals page allowed an authenticated employee to perform transactions according to the business rules for the customer renting the equipment.

• The returns page allowed an authenticated employee to perform transactions according to the business rules for the customer returning the equipment.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thank you for your time.
